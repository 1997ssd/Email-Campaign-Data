# Email-Campaign-Data
Visualising email campaign data using Pandas

Summary
Following our first year using Campaign Monitor, it is important that we systematically review the effectiveness of this tool. As the number of schools, we work with as an organisation continues to grow, our need to send out tailored communication to our members increases also. Campaign Monitor tracks the metrics of each campaign and overtime. This report tracks the performance of each of our campaigns for the academic year 2022-2023 and makes recommendations for how to improve our reach for the next academic year.

Key findings:
How many campaigns were sent?
428

Which was the most popular campaign?

Key recommendations
Lowest performing campaigns coincide with teacher strike dates in 2022/23. We should review our email campaign schedule if new industrial strikes are announced. We should avoid sending any campaigns during strike weeks, as these result in lower click rates. 

It is important know which campaigns are causing our members to disengage with us. This will allow us to better formulate future campaigns to maximise subscriber rate and reach.

We need to create a new segment for staff who do not work with us directly. When campaigns are untailored it causes more induviduals to unsubscribe. The majority of our unsubscribes are teachers who don’t directly work with us. Because we aim to foster a whole school oracy approach, we need to do more work to re-engage staff members who don’t normally attend our programmes.

The overwhelming majority of our subscribers are English and Humanities teachers. We need to provide tailored information and resources targeted at STEM teachers to demonstrate the importance and applicability of oracy across all subject areas.

Oracy reports remain a valuable part of the membership and result in high engagement. This suggest that schools value the data. We should continue to use these and conceptualise ways to make them more accessible for staff who do not normally work with data.
